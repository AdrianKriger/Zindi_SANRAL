It seemed a great way to practice data wrangling with ```pandas``` and ```geopandas``` and work at Machine Learning. I'm a novice so the probability that everything I do here is wrong; is very high. \n","\n","The intention is to have a number of ```notebooks```. We'll start with simple data manipulation and building a Machine Learning ```model```. Then we'll harvest weather data and include that. Car count and travel time will be included as we go along. \n","\n","We start with Machine Learning; but I'm on the [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) course and I'd like to give their ```tabular``` method a try: so the intension is to end with that.   \n","\n","### Data\n","\n","These solutions use the data provided by the [Zindi competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/uber-movement-sanral-cape-town-challenge/data). It's local and a wonderful way to create knowledge.\n"," \n","It mentions weather data can be added. I'll use [NOAA NCDC Integrated Surface Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd); to utilize the skills learnt through the [Universtity of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) [Geo-Python](https://geo-python.github.io/site/) and [Automating GIS-processes](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/) courses. \n","   \n","### Process:\n","\n","There will hopefully be two solutions: A [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/). We'll build towards the later. \n","\n","    Process:\n","\n","       1) Wrangle data, run a simple model and make predictions;\n","       2) Harvest and add weather, update predictions;\n","       3) Harvest car count and repeat;\n","       4) Include travel time and repeat;\n","       5) Give fastai a go.\n","    "]}]}
